# Tap That App

#### An angular web-project to organize a tap room.

#### By Taylor Pokoj & Tyler Suderman

## description
This project was intended primarily as practice in typescript and angularJs2. The main class in the project is "Keg", of which multiple instances are held in an array which functions as storage. Every piece of functionality was intentionally refactored into it's own component, no matter how small, in order to gain experience with data-binding, custom event emitters, and other tools new to us with angularJs.
